  <p>
In our mathematical adventures so far we have studied linear, quadratic, 
and radical functions. The simplicity of these functions is useful when 
introducing new concepts such as transformations, composition, and 
inverse functions; but it is somewhat restrictive when we wish to 
consider interesting real-world application problems. <xref ref="test" />
