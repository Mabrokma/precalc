</ul>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the \(\sqrt{\phantom{x}}\) symbol.
		This symbols is used to turn numbers into their square roots. Sometimes it's
		simple to do this on paper or in our heads, and sometimes it helps a lot to
		have a calculator. We can see some calculations in FIX!!! <a class="margintable" href="functions.html#margintable-1"></a>.</p>

		<p>The \(\sqrt{\phantom{x}}\) symbol represents a <em>process</em>; it's a way for us to
		turn numbers into other numbers. This idea of finding some numbers based on other numbers is
		fundamental to science and mathematics that use college-level algebra. </p>
<article class="theorem-like" id="definition-1"><h5>
<span class="type">Definition</span> <span class="counter"></span> <span class="title">Function</span>
</h5>A function is a process for turning numbers into (potentially) different numbers. 
			It's important that any input consistently produces the same output.</article><p>This definition is so broad that you probably use functions all the time.</p>
<article class="example-like" id="example-1"><h5>
<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="counter"></span>
</h5>
<p>Think about each of these examples. How do they fit the defintion of a function?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the year a person was born to determine how old they are, you are using a function.</li>
<li>If you look up the Kelly Blue Book value of a Mazda Proteg based on how old it is, 
				you are using a function.</li>
<li>If you use the the amount of money that you have on you to determine how many beers you could buy for 
				your friends at the bar, you are using a function.</li>
</ul></article><p>The process of using \(\sqrt{\phantom{x}}\) to change numbers might feel more ``mathematical''
		than these examples. Let's continue thinking about \(\sqrt{\phantom{x}}\) for now, since
		it's a formula-like symbol that we are familiar with. Even though we live in the age of computers,
		this symbol is not found on most
		keyboards. This doesn't stop people from using computers to calculate square roots though. Computer
		technicians write \(\sq[(]\) when they want to compute a square root, as we see in FIX!!! <a class="margintable" href="functions.html#margintable-2"></a>.</p>
                        Values of \(\sq[x]\)
                        <thead></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="">\(\sq[\num{9}]\)</td>
<td align="">\({}={}\)</td>
<td align="">\num{3}</td>

<td align="">\({}={}\)</td>
<td align="">\num{1/2}</td>

                <p>The parentheses in \(\sq[(]\) are very important. To see why, try to put yourself in the
		``mind'' of a computer, and look closely at \(\sq\num{16}\). The computer will recognize \(\sq\)
		and know that it needs to compute a square root. But computers are very picky with how they interpret input, and 
		they might not see the entire number \(\num{16}\). A computer might read as far as \(\sq\num{1}\) and think that it needs to compute this.
		That would leave \(1\) with a ``6'' character still hanging. The final result would be \(\num{16}\), and we know we inteded the  
		result to be \(4\). And so the purpose of the parentheses in \(\sq[\num{16}]\) is 
		to denote exactly what number needs to be operated on.</p>
<p>This use of \(\sq[(]\) serves as a model for the standard notation that is used all over the world to
        	write down most functions. By having a standard notation for communicating about functions,
        	people in China, Venezuela, Senegal, and the United States can all communicate mathematics
        	with each other more easily.</p>
<p>Functions have their own names. We've seen a function named \(\sq\), but any name you can
        	imagine is allowable. In the sciences, it is common to name functions with whole words,
        	like \(\operatorname{weight}\) or \(\operatorname{health\_index}\). In mathematics, we often
        	abbreviate such function names to \(w\) or \(h\). And of course, since the word ``function''
        	starts with ``f'', we will often name a function \(f\).</p>
<p>It's crucial to continue reminding ourselves that functions are <em>processes</em> for
        	changing numbers; they are not numbers themselves. And that means that we have a potential
        	for confusion that we need to stay aware of. In some contexts, the symbol \(t\) might
        	represent a variablea number that is represented by a letter. For example, it might represent 
		how much time has passed since something started. But in other contexts, \(t\)
        	might represent a functiona process for changing numbers into other numbers. For example, if you 
		have a year in mind, \(t\) might be the function that tells you how many tornadoes there were that year. 
		So \(t\) would be a process for turning years into numbers of tornadoes. By
        	staying conscious of the context of an investigation, we avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Next we need to discuss how we go about using a function's name.</p>
			Function notation
			The standard notation for referring to functions involves giving the function itself a name, and then writing
			\[\begin{array}{cc}
                                \text{name}\\
                                \text{of}\\
                                \text{function}
                        \end{array}
                        \left(
                        \begin{array}{cc}
                                \\
                                \text{input}\\
                                \\
                        \end{array}\right)\]
		<article class="example-like" id="example-2"><h5>
<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="counter"></span>
</h5>
<p>\(f(\num{13})\) is pronounced ``f of 13''. The word ``of'' is very important,
        		because it reminds us that \(f\) is a process and we are about to apply that
        		process to the input value \(\num{13}\). So \(f\) is the function, \(\num{13}\) is the
        		input, and \(f(\num{13})\) is the output we'd get from using \(\num{13}\) as input.</p>
<p>\(f(x)\) is pronounced ``f of x''. This is just like the previous example,
        		except that the input is not some specific number. The value of \(x\) could be
        		\(\num{13}\) or any other number. Whatever \(x\)'s value, \(f(x)\) means the corresponding
        		output from the function \(f\).</p>
<p>\(\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}(2009)\) is pronounced ``BudgetDeficit of 2009''.
        		This is probably a function that takes a year as input, and gives that
        		year's federal budget deficit as output. The process here of changing a year
        		into a dollar amount might not involve any mathematical formula, but rather
        		looking up information from the Congressional Budget Office's website.</p>
<p>\(\operatorname{Celsius}(F)\) is pronounced ``Celsius of F''. This is probably
        		a function that takes a Fahrenheit temperature as input and gives the
        		corresponding Celsius temperature as output. Maybe a formula is used to do this;
        		maybe a chart or some other tool is used to do this. Here, \(\operatorname{Celsius}\)
        		is the function, \(F\) is the input variable, and \(\operatorname{Celsius}(F)\) is the output from the function.</p></article>
                        Function notation (continued)
                        While a function has a name like \(f\), and the input to that function often
                	has a variable name like \(x\), the expression \(f(x)\) represents the output of
                	the function. To be clear, \(f(x)\) is <em>not</em> a function. Rather, \(f\) is a
                	function, and \(f(x)\) its the output when the number \(x\) is used as input.
                <p>As mentioned earlier, we need to remain conscious of the context of any symbol we
       		are using. It's possible for \(f\) to represent a function (a process), but it's also
       		possible for \(f\) to represent a variable (a number). Similarly, parentheses might
       		indicate the input of a function, or they might indicate that two numbers need to
       		be multiplied. It's up to our judgment to interpret mathematical expressions in the
       		right context. Consider the expression \(a(b)\). This could easily mean the output of
       		a function \(a\) with input \(b\). It could also mean that two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) need
       		to be multiplied. It all depends on the context in which these symbols are being used.</p>
			<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-1"><h5>
<span class="type">Exercise</span> <span class="counter"></span>
</h5>
<p>Describe your own example of a function using experience from your life. You will need some 
				kind of input variable, like ``number of years since 2000'' or ``weight of a bowling ball''. You will 
				need a process for turning that number into a different kind of number. The process does not need to
                		involve a formula; a verbal description would be fine.</p>
<p>Give your function a name. Write the symbol that you would use to represent
                		input. Write the symbol(s) that you would use to represent output.</p></article>Solution. Answers will vary.
		<p>Sometimes it's helpful to think of a function as a machine.</p>
<p>This illustrates how complicated functions are. A number is just a number. But a function has the capacity to 
		take in all kinds of different numbers into it's hopper (feeding tray) and do different things to each of them. So
		functions are complicated.</p>

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="counter">1.1.1</span> <span class="title">Tables and Graphs</span>
</h4>
<p>Since functions are potentially so complicated, we seek out new ways to understand
        		them better. Two basic tools for understanding a function better are tables and graphs.</p>
<article class="example-like" id="example-3"><h5>
<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="counter"></span>
</h5>
<p>Consider the function \(\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}\), that takes in a year as
        			its input and outputs the US federal budget deficit for that year. For example,
        			the Congressional Budget Office's website tells us that
        			\(\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}(2009)\) is \(\SI{1.41}[\$]{\trillion}\). If we'd like
        			to understand this function better, we might make a table of all the inputs and
        			outputs we can find. Using the CBO's 
				website<sup><a class="footnote" knowl="./knowl/footnote-1.html">1</a></sup>, we put together
