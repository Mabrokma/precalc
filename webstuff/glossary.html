         <h3><a name="exponential">Exponential functions</a> </h3>
         Exponential functions have the form  `f(x) = a b^x` where 
         both `a` and `b>0` are real numbers. We call `b` the base.

        <h3>Concave up</a></h3>
        A function `f` is concave up on an interval if one of the following statements is true:
            <li>`f` increases at an increasing rate</li>
            <li>`f` decreases at an increasing rate</li>
