As of 10/27/14, I'm working in the folder called chapers. I'm converting the functions chapter that we already have.

funcitons.xml is mimicking Rob's example document. I have just been progressing through the original functions tex file
(copied as functionsOriginalTeX.tex). Paragraph content can be easily copied. I am skipping over harder things like
our special environments and marking them with <todo> tags.

This is a starting point, but we will have to make changes to the structure. This sample that I am mimicking is a 
standalone article. It has a preamble. We have a pretty complicated mainfile, so we had planned to let xml create our
chapters to be included with \include. So we'll have to work on that. I feel like mimicking the sample is a first step 
though.

Another problem I have run into is when commands that are defined in packages or in the mainfile are used. For now I 
am just making crude replacements for them in the macros section of functions.xml, and tagging the macros section that
attention is needed there. 

I haven't gotten html production to work. But 
xsltproc ../xsl/omd2tex.xsl functions.xml > functions.tex
works to create a standalone .tex article, which compiles to pdf fine (except for my crude macros).

Ended 10/27/14 at line 81 of functionsOriginalTeX.tex.

============================

Created omdchapter2tex.xsl. Probably could have used omd2tex.xsl, but this helps me compartmentalize.
In omdchapter2tex.xsl, I am adding things. So far I added the xsl to make the minitoc and outcomes list
appear for the chatper.

So as of 11/1/14, use omdchapter2tex.xsl to convert function.xml to functions.tex, then compile precalc.tex.
