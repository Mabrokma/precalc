          <p> In our mathematical adventures so far we have studied linear, quadratic, 
            and radical functions. The simplicity of these functions is useful when 
            introducing new concepts such as transformations, composition, and 
            inverse functions; but it is somewhat restrictive when we wish to 
            consider interesting real-world application problems.  </p>
          <p> For example, let's say that we were interested in modeling the 
            temperature of a hot cup of coffee since it was first poured. We cannot 
            write a formula for such a model yet, but perhaps <xref ref="exp-fig-motivatecool"/> depicts a reasonable
            approximation of the graph of it. Or perhaps
            we would like to model the growth in population of the world; again, 
            we can not write a formula for such a model at this stage, but you 
            might agree that <xref ref="exp-fig-motivatepop"/> is a likely candidate 
            for the graph of the model.  </p>
          <p> Clearly the functions depicted in <xref ref="exp-fig-motivate"/> belong to 
            a different class than those that we have considered so far. In fact, they 
            belong to the class known as <em>exponential</em> functions, the study of 
            which is a fascinating topic that encompasses many applications, and a lot 
            of interesting mathematical features. Prepare yourself for a colorful 
            and exciting
            journey that will take us through the landscape of some of the most useful 
            functions that we will ever encounter.  </p>

            <p><xref ref="exp-tab-salary" beginsentence="true"/> shows how much money you would make per day, 
              in cents, for the first 5 days, and how much you would make on the 10th and 30th days. 
              The amount you make on day 30 is 1073741824 cents, which is
              <me> 
                \$10\textrm{,}737\textrm{,}418.24   
              </me>
              That's over 10 million dollars in a single day! How did this happen? Can we develop 
              a formula to help us understand the mathematics behind this?  </p>
            <p>It seems that the dollar amount is multiplied by 2 each day. An alternative way 
              of writing our daily income is shown in <xref ref="exp-tab-salaryalt"/>. Can we write 
              a formula that calculates the pay, <m>p</m>, in cents, as a function of the number of days
              worked, <m>d</m>? 
              According to <xref ref="exp-tab-salaryalt"/>, it appears that the day of the month is in the exponent, 
              so let's write
              <me>
                p = 2^{d}
              </me>
              where <m>d</m> is a positive integer. This is our first example of an exponential function -- exploring 
              these types of functions is our primary goal in this chapter.</p>

            <statement> <p>An exponential function is a function <m>f</m> that can be described with the formula

            <title>Rice on a chessboard</title>
            <p>Many years ago there lived a Queen who loved to play games; so much so, that 
              she had a jester dedicated to devising interesting games for her. The Queen 
              particularly enjoyed mathematical games.</p>
            <p>One day the jester brought her a chessboard (see <xref ref="exp-fig-grainsofrice"/>) and a bucket filled with rice.</p>

              that as she progresses from square to square, the number of grains appears to be <em>tripling</em> each time.</p>
            <p>The Queen, being mathematically inclined, decides to try to model 
              the game using a formula. She decides to  let <m>x</m> be the number 
              corresponding to the square on the chessboard, and let <m>g(x)</m> represent 
              the number of grains of rice on that square, and  assumes that she 
              works each row from left to right as she moves up the chessboard.</p>

            <p>The Queen notices that each of the numbers she writes in <xref ref="exp-tab-grainsofrice"/>
              can be written as a power of <m>3</m>, and concludes that the formula for the number
              of grains on square <m>x</m> of the chessboard is
              <me>
                g(x)=3^x
              </me>
              The Queen decides to test her formula by calculating the number of grains 
              on the <m>\nth{17}</m> square. She finds that
              <me>
                g(17)=\num{129 140 163}
              </me>
              and says that there are (or would be, if they could fit) \num{129 140 163} grains of rice on the \nth{17} square -- wow!</p>
            <p> Of course, the Queen knows that this formula only works when <m>x</m> takes the 
              integer values <m>\{1,2,\ldots,64\}</m>, but wonders what would happen if 
              she graphed <m>g</m> on her calculator (which she always has with her for just 
              such a situation). The Queen graphs <m>g</m> on her calculator assuming 
              that <m>g</m> can take values outside of the contextual domain, and 
              obtains the graph in <xref ref="exp-fig-queensgraph"/>.</p>
            <p>The Queen concludes that <m>g</m> is increasing at a faster and faster rate, and 
              cannot imagine ever being able to fit the appropriate amount of rice on 
              each square.</p>
