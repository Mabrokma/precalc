    <outcome> Determine a function's concavity based on a table of values, a graph, or a description. </outcome>
  </outcomes>
  <p> In our mathematical adventures so far we have studied linear, quadratic, 
    and radical functions. The simplicity of these functions is useful when 
    introducing new concepts such as transformations, composition, and 
    inverse functions; but it is somewhat restrictive when we wish to 
    consider interesting real-world application problems.  </p>
  <p> For example, let's say that we were interested in modeling the 
    temperature of a hot cup of coffee since it was first poured. We cannot 
    write a formula for such a model yet, but perhaps <xref ref="exp-fig-motivatecool"/> depicts a reasonable
    approximation of the graph of it. Or perhaps
    we would like to model the growth in population of the world; again, 
    we can not write a formula for such a model at this stage, but you 
    might agree that <xref ref="exp-fig-motivatepop"/> is a likely candidate 
    for the graph of the model.  </p>
  <p> Clearly the functions depicted in <xref ref="exp-fig-motivate"/> belong to 
    a different class than those that we have considered so far. In fact, they 
    belong to the class known as <em>exponential</em> functions, the study of 
    which is a fascinating topic that encompasses many applications, and a lot 
    of interesting mathematical features. Prepare yourself for a colorful 
    and exciting
    journey that will take us through the landscape of some of the most useful 
    functions that we will ever encounter.  </p>

      in cents, for the first 5 days, and how much you would make on the 10th and 30th days. 
      The amount you make on day 30 is 1073741824 cents, which is
      <me> 
        \$10\textrm{,}737\textrm{,}418.24   
      </me>
      That's over 10 million dollars in a single day! How did this happen? Can we develop 
      a formula to help us understand the mathematics behind this?  </p>
    <p>It seems that the dollar amount is multiplied by 2 each day. An alternative way 
      of writing our daily income is shown in <xref ref="exp-tab-salaryalt"/>. Can we write 
      a formula that calculates the pay, <m>p</m>, in cents, as a function of the number of days
      worked, <m>d</m>? 
      According to <xref ref="exp-tab-salaryalt"/>, it appears that the day of the month is in the exponent, 
      so let's write
      <me>
        p = 2^{d}
      </me>
      where <m>d</m> is a positive integer. This is our first example of an exponential function -- exploring 
      these types of functions is our primary goal in this chapter.</p>

    <title>Exponential functions</title>
    <statement> <p>An exponential function is a function <m>f</m> that can be described with the formula 
        <me>
          f(x)=a\,b^x

        where <m>a</m> is a non-zero real number (<m>a\in\mathbb{R}, a\ne 0</m>) and <m>b</m> is a positive 
        number other than 1 (<m>b>0</m>, <m>b\neq 1</m>). Notice that the variable is in the exponent 
        and the base is the fixed constant <m>b</m>.</p>
      <p>Note that in an exponential term the base is fixed and the variable is in the 
        exponent (e.g. <m>5\cdot 4^x</m>), whereas in a polynomial term the exponent is fixed the base is the variable (e.g <m>6x^3</m>).</p>

    <title>Rice on a chessboard</title>
    <p>Many years ago there lived a Queen who loved to play games; so much so, that 
      she had a jester dedicated to devising interesting games for her. The Queen 
      particularly enjoyed mathematical games.</p>
    <p>One day the jester brought her a chessboard (see <xref ref="exp-fig-grainsofrice"/>) and a bucket filled with rice.</p>

    <p>The jester asked the Queen to follow these instructions
      <ul>
        <li>Place 3 grains of rice on the square in the lower left hand corner of the board.</li>
        <li>Place 9 grains of rice on the square immediately to the right of the square you were just working with.</li>
        <li>Place 27 grains of rice on the square immediately to the right of the square you were just working with.</li>
      </ul>The Queen starts to notice a pattern, and records her findings in <xref ref="exp-tab-grainsofrice"/>. She also notes
      that as she progresses from square to square, the number of grains appears to be <em>tripling</em> each time.</p>
    <p>The Queen, being mathematically inclined, decides to try to model 
      the game using a formula. She decides to  let <m>x</m> be the number 
      corresponding to the square on the chessboard, and let <m>g(x)</m> represent 
      the number of grains of rice on that square, and  assumes that she 
      works each row from left to right as she moves up the chessboard.</p>

    <p>The Queen notices that each of the numbers she writes in <xref ref="exp-tab-grainsofrice"/>
      can be written as a power of <m>3</m>, and concludes that the formula for the number
      of grains on square <m>x</m> of the chessboard is
      <me>
        g(x)=3^x
      </me>
      The Queen decides to test her formula by calculating the number of grains 
      on the \nth{17} square. She finds that
      <me>
        g(17)=\num{129 140 163}
      </me>
      and says that there are (or would be, if they could fit) \num{129 140 163} grains of rice on the \nth{17} square -- wow!</p>
    <p> Of course, the Queen knows that this formula only works when <m>x</m> takes the 
      integer values <m>\{1,2,\ldots,64\}</m>, but wonders what would happen if 
      she graphed <m>g</m> on her calculator (which she always has with her for just 
      such a situation). The Queen graphs <m>g</m> on her calculator assuming 
      that <m>g</m> can take values outside of the contextual domain, and 
      obtains the graph in <xref ref="exp-fig-queensgraph"/>.</p>
    <p>The Queen concludes that <m>g</m> is increasing at a faster and faster rate, and 
      cannot imagine ever being able to fit the appropriate amount of rice on 
      each square.</p>

  <exercises style="try-it-yourself">
    <exercise>
      <statement>Repeat <xref ref="exp-prob-queenschessboard"/>, but instead of <em>tripling</em> the 
        number of grains of rice on each square, try <em>quadrupling</em> them.</statement>
      <solution><p>The equivalent of the function <m>g</m> is <m>h</m> and has formula <m>h(x)=4^x</m>.</p></solution>

  <p>We have so far seen two exponential functions, <m>p</m> and <m>g</m>, both of which increase 
    at a faster and faster rate. You may wonder if all exponential functions behave in this way --
    the next example demonstrates that they do not.</p>

    <title>Folding paper</title>
    <p>Have you ever tried to fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times? No matter the size 
      of the paper, it becomes quite difficult -- the MythBusters tried quite an elaborate experiment 
      along these lines. <fn><url href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRAEBbotuIE"/></fn> </p>
    <p>We are going to experiment with paper folding and study the mathematics behind the results.
      The area of a <q>letter</q> sheet of paper is <quantity><mag>8.5</mag><unit base="inch"/></quantity> by 
      <quantity><mag>11</mag><unit base="inch"/></quantity>, or <quantity><mag>93.5</mag><unit base="inch" exp="2"/></quantity>. 
      We will use two decimal places in what follows.</p>
    <p>If we fold a sheet of letter paper in half, the visible surface area is
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\SI{93.52}{\square\inch}}{2} &amp; =\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\SI{93.5}{\square\inch}</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =\SI{46.75}{\square\inch}                       </mrow>
      </md>
      Note that we say, <q>visible</q>, because the actual surface area of the paper has not changed.</p>
    <p>If we fold the sheet in half again, the visible surface area is 
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\SI{46.75}{\square\inch}}{2} &amp; = \frac{\SI{93.52}{\square\inch}}{4}               </mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\SI{93.5}{\square\inch} </mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; \approx \SI{23.38}{\square\inch}                    </mrow>
      </md>
      If we fold the sheet in half a third time, the visible surface area is
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\SI{93.5}{\square\inch}}{8} &amp; = \left(  \frac{1}{2}\right)^3\SI{93.5}{\square\inch} </mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; \approx \SI{11.69}{\square\inch}                      </mrow>
    </md></p>
    <p>Let's try and generalize our results by letting <m>x</m> be the number of 
      paper folds; <m>x</m> will start at 0, and increase in integer values. 
      <xref ref="exp-tab-foldingpaper" beginsentence="true"/> has two columns, one for the number of folds (up to 7), and one for the visible surface area 
      of the (folded) paper. </p>

      <statement><p><xref ref="exp-prob-queenschessboard"/> is a version of the Legend of Payasam.</p>
        <p>According to legend, Lord Krishna once appeared in the form of a sage in the court of a 
          king who ruled a region of southern India. Lord Krishna challenged the king to a game of chess. 
          The king, being a chess 
          enthusiast, gladly accepted the challenge.</p>
        <p>The players decided to put a wager on the game; the king let the sage choose the prize.
          The sage told the 
          king that he was a man of few material needs, and thus all he wished for was a few grains of rice. </p>
        <p>The sage suggested that the amount of rice should be determined 
          using the chessboard in the following manner. 
          Two grains of rice will be placed on the first square, four grains on the second square, eight 
          on the third square, and so on. That is, every square will have double the 
          number of grains as its predecessor.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing the demand, the king was unhappy since the sage requested only a few grains of 
          rice instead of other riches from the kingdom.</p>
        <p>We are going to attach monetary value to our calculations. We will assume that
          <ul>
            <li>there are approximately 7200 grains of rice in a cup;</li>
            <li>there are 3 cups of rice in a 1-lb bag;</li>

      <title>Melting of Arctic Sea Ice </title>
      <statement>
        Using satellite imagery, scientists now believe that the Arctic sea ice cover is being reduced in area by <quantity><mag>8</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> every ten years.  
        In September of 2005 the area of the ice cover was 5.35 million <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>, 
        according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center <fn><url href="http://nsidc.org/"/></fn>.

            A graph indicates that about <m>8.3</m> decades after 2005 (or in 2088), the Arctic sea ice cover will have reached half of its 2005 level.

          <p>
            <m>A(-1)=5.35(0.92)^{-1}\approx5.82</m>. According to the model, in 1995 the Arctic sea ice level was about 5.82 million <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>.

        <statement>
          Use the two data points you determined in <xref ref="exp-prob-icehalflife" autoname="plural"/> and <xref ref="exp-prob-1995ice"/> to generate 
          a <em>linear</em> model for the melting of the Arctic sea ice cover.  Comment on the differences in your two models' predictions for 2010, 2030, and 2050.    
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Using <m>B(t)</m> to represent a linear model for the ice cover, where <m>t</m> is measured in decades since 2005, <m>B</m> has slope of <m>2.675-5.815/(8.3-(-1))</m> million 
            <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/><per base="decade"/></quantity>
            or <m>-0.3377</m> million <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/><per base="decade"/></quantity>. Using the point-slope form of a line equation, <m>B(t)=-0.3377(t+1)+5.815</m>.

            For the year 2010, <m>t=0.5</m>. <m>A(0.5)\approx5.13</m> and <m>B(0.5)\approx5.31</m>. So in 2010, the exponential model predicts lower ice cover than the linear model.

            For the year 2030, <m>t=2.5</m>. <m>A(2.5)\approx4.34</m> and <m>B(2.5)\approx4.63</m>. So in 2030, the exponential model still predicts lower ice cover than the linear model, and the difference is larger than it was in 2010.

            For the year 2050, <m>t=4.5</m>. <m>A(4.5)\approx3.67</m> and <m>B(4.5)\approx3.95</m>. So in 2050, the exponential model still predicts lower ice cover than the linear model.

          predict the Arctic sea ice cover will melt to less than <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>?
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Since <m>A(t)</m> and <m>B(t)</m> are measured in million <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>, 
            we should work with the value <m>0.0001</m> million <quantity><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>. 
            A graph shows that <m>B(16.2)\approx0.0001</m> and <m>A(130.5)\approx0.0001</m>. So the linear model predicts that after 6.2 decades (in 2212) 
            the Arctic sea ice cover will melt to less than <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo" exp="2"/></quantity>. 
            The exponential model predicts that this will not happen for 130.5 decades, or until the year 3310.
