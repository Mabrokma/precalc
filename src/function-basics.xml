    <p>The <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> symbol represents a <em>process</em>; it's a way for us to turn numbers into other numbers. This idea of finding some numbers based on other numbers is fundamental to science and mathematics that use college-level algebra. </p>

    <definition>
        <title>Function</title>
        <statement>
            <p>A <term>function</term> is a process for turning numbers into (potentially) different numbers. It's important that any input consistently produces the same output.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>This definition is so broad that you probably use functions all the time.</p>

    <example>
        <title>Examples of Functions</title>

        <p>Think about each of these examples. How do they fit the defintion of a function?</p>

        <ul><li>If you use the year a person was born to determine how old they are, you are using a function.</li>
            <li>If you look up the Kelly Blue Book value of a Mazda Miata based on how old it is, you are using a function.</li>
            <li>If you use the the amount of money that you have on you to determine how many drinks you could buy for your friends at the bar, you are using a function.</li>
        </ul>
 
    </example>


    <p>The process of using <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> to change numbers might feel more <q>mathematical</q> than these examples. Let's continue thinking about <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> for now, since it's a formula-like symbol that we are familiar with. Even though we live in the age of computers, this symbol is not found on most keyboards. This doesn't stop people from using computers to calculate square roots though. Computer technicians write <m>\SQ</m> when they want to compute a square root, as we see in <xref ref="table-sqrts"/>.</p>

    <p>The parentheses in <m>\SQ</m> are very important. To see why, try to put yourself in the <q>mind</q> of a computer, and look closely at <q><m>\sq16</m></q>. The computer will recognize <q><m>\sq</m></q> and know that it needs to compute a square root. But computers are very picky with how they interpret input, and they might not see the entire number <q><m>16</m></q>. A computer might read as far as <q><m>\sq1</m></q> and think that it needs to compute this. That would leave <q><m>1</m></q> with a <q><m>6</m></q> character still hanging. The final result would be <m>16</m>, and we know we inteded the result to be <m>4</m>. And so the purpose of the parentheses in <q><m>\SQ[16]</m></q> is to denote exactly what number needs to be operated on.</p>

    <p>This use of <m>\SQ</m> serves as a model for the standard notation that is used all over the world to discuss most functions. By having a standard notation for communicating about functions, people in China, Venezuela, Senegal, and the United States can all communicate mathematics with each other more easily.</p>

    <p>Functions have their own names. We've seen a function named <q><m>\sq</m></q>, but any name you can imagine is allowable. In the sciences, it is common to name functions with whole words, like <q><m>\operatorname{weight}</m></q> or <q><m>\operatorname{health\_index}</m></q>. In mathematics, we often abbreviate such function names to <q><m>w</m></q> or <q><m>h</m></q>. And of course, since the word <term>function</term> starts with <q>f</q>, we will often name a function <q><m>f</m></q>.</p>

    <p>It's helpful to always remind ourselves that functions are <em>processes</em> for changing numbers; they are not numbers themselves. So there's a potential cause for confusion that we can stay on top of. In some contexts, the symbol <m>t</m> might represent a variable<emdash />a number that is represented by a letter. For example, it might represent how much time has passed since something started. But in other contexts, <m>t</m> might represent a function<emdash />a process for changing numbers into other numbers. For example, if you provide a year for input, <m>t</m> might be the function that tells you how many tornadoes there were that year. So <m>t</m> would be a process for turning a year into a number of tornadoes. By staying conscious of the context of an investigation, we can avoid confusion.</p>

    <p>Next we need to discuss how we go about using a function's name.</p>

    <standout xml:id="function-notation">
        <title>Function Notation</title>

        <p>The standard notation for discussing functions involves giving the function itself a name, and then writing <me>\fe{\begin{matrix}\text{name}\\\text{of}\\\text{function}\end{matrix}}{\begin{matrix}\,\\\text{input}\\\,\end{matrix}}</me></p>

    </standout>

    <example>
        <title>Use of Function Notation</title>

        <p><m>\fe{f}{13}</m> is pronounced <q>f of 13</q>. The word <q>of</q> is very important, because it reminds us that <m>f</m> is a process and we are about to apply that process to the input value <m>13</m>. So <m>f</m> is the function, <m>13</m> is the input, and <m>\fe{f}{13}</m> is the output we'd get from using <m>13</m> as input.</p>

        <p><m>\fe{f}{x}</m> is pronounced <q>f of x</q>. This is just like the previous example, except that the input is not some specific number. The value of <m>x</m> could be <m>13</m> or any other number. Whatever <m>x</m>'s value, <m>\fe{f}{x}</m> means the corresponding output from the function <m>f</m>.</p>

        <p><m>\fe{\operatorname{BudgetDeficit}}{2009}</m> is pronounced <q>BudgetDeficit of 2009</q>. This is probably a function that takes a year as input, and gives that year's federal budget deficit as output. The process here of changing a year into a dollar amount might not involve any mathematical formula, but rather looking up information from the Congressional Budget Office's website.</p>

        <p><m>\fe{\operatorname{Celsius}}{F}</m> is pronounced <q>Celsius of F</q>. This is probably a function that takes a Fahrenheit temperature as input and gives the corresponding Celsius temperature as output. Maybe a formula is used to do this; maybe a chart or some other tool is used to do this. Here, <m>\operatorname{Celsius}</m> is the function, <m>F</m> is the input variable, and <m>\fe{\operatorname{Celsius}}{F}</m> is the output from the function.</p>

    </example>

    <standout xml:id="function-notation-continued">
        <title>Function Notation (continued)</title>

        <p>While a function has a name like <m>f</m>, and the input to that function often has a variable name like <m>x</m>, the expression <m>\fe{f}{x}</m> represents the output of the function. To be clear, <m>\fe{f}{x}</m> is <em>not</em> a function. Rather, <m>f</m> is a function, and <m>\fe{f}{x}</m> is its output when the number <m>x</m> is used as input. When people are speaking quickly, they may refer to <q><m>\fe{f}{x}</m></q> as a function, but this is not strictly correct.</p>

    </standout>


    <p>As mentioned earlier, we need to remain conscious of the context of any symbol we are using. It's possible for <m>f</m> to represent a function (a process), but it's also possible for <m>f</m> to represent a variable (a number). Similarly, parentheses might indicate the input of a function, or they might indicate that two numbers need to be multiplied. It's up to our judgment to interpret mathematical expressions in the right context. Consider the expression <m>a(b)</m>. This could easily mean the output of a function <m>a</m> with input <m>b</m>. It could also mean that two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> need to be multiplied. It all depends on the context in which these symbols are being used.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Describe your own example of a function that has real context to it. You will need some kind of input variable, like <q>number of years since 2000</q> or <q>weight of the passengers in my car</q>. You will need a process for using that number to bring about a different kind of number. The process does not need to involve a formula; a verbal description would be great, as would a formula.</p>

                <p>Give your function a name. Write the symbol(s) that you would use to represent input. Write the symbol(s) that you would use to represent output.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it's helpful to think of a function as a machine.</p>

    <todo>Fancy tikz picture of a function machine. </todo>

    <p>This illustrates how complicated functions are. A number is just a number. But a function has the capacity to take in all kinds of different numbers into it's hopper (feeding tray) and do different things to each of them. So functions are complicated.</p>
