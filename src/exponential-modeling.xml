    <title>Simple population models</title>
    <p>
      Exponential functions are often used to model the size of a population as time passes.  A population 
      could be growing or declining at an exponential rate.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <title>Simple population model</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If an initial population, <m>P_0</m>, changes by the same percentage each year, then 
          the population at time <m>t</m> in years, <m>P(t)</m>, is given by the formula
          <me>
            P(t)=P_0(1+r)^t, 
          </me>
          where <m>r</m> is the decimal form of the percentage change.
        </p>
        <p>
          When dealing with human population models, we generally restrict the domain of <m>P</m> to integer values of <m>t</m>. This 
          means that we are only modeling population values on one specific day of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that <m>r</m> can be positive (for a growing population) or negative (for a declining population).  
          Also, note that we don't have to measure time in years.  Using years makes sense for modeling human populations, 
          but a smaller unit like hours might make sense for a bacteria population.

        At the beginning of the year 2000, the population of One Horse was 10,000 people. By the beginning
        of 2005 the population had decreased to 9700. Assuming exponential decay, determine the population 
        at the beginning of 2012. Round your answer to the nearest person.

        <p>Over 5 years, the population decreased by 300 people.  As <m>\frac{300}{10000}=0.03</m>, the population 
          decreased by <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> over the five-year period.  The growth factor for this five-year period is <m>0.97</m> and 
          therefore the growth factor for one year is <m>(0.97)^{1/5}</m>.  Using this, the population <m>P(t)</m> at

    <title>Radioactive decay</title>
    <p>One common application of decaying exponential functions involves radioactivity.  If you have a substance 
      where some of the atoms are radioactive, the radioactive atoms will decay into other atoms in a very predictable way.  
      In fact, each radioactive element has an 
      associated half-life, which is the time it takes for <quantity><mag>50</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> of the radioactive atoms to decay into something else.  </p>
    <example xml:id="exp-prob-radioactive">
      <author>Simonds</author>
      <date>Feb 2011</date>
      <p>
        Suppose that we have 8000 atoms of Carbon-12 (which is non-radioactive).  Without an intervening act, 1,000,000 years from 
        now that sample of carbon will still have 8000 atoms of Carbon-12.  However, if we start with a sample 
        of 8000 
        radioactive C-14 atoms, over time fewer and fewer of those atoms remain radioactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we define <m>R(t)</m> to be the number of radioactive atoms that remain in the sample <m>t</m> years from today, then we can 
        model the function <m>R</m> using the template <m>R(t)=a\,b^t</m> for unknown 
        constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  The number of remaining radioactive atoms <m>t</m> years from today is 
        shown in <xref ref="exp-tab-C14decay"/>.  
      </p>
      <table xml:id="exp-tab-C14decay">
        <caption>Decaying Radioactive Carbon-14</caption>
        <tabular>
          <col halign="."/>

          <thead>

          <tfoot/>
        </tabular>
      </table>
      <p>
        Using the data in <xref ref="exp-tab-C14decay"/> we can determine the formula for <m>R(t)</m>, 
        the number of atoms that remain radioactive after <m>t</m> years; choosing 
        two ordered pairs and assuming that <m>R(t)=a\ b^t</m>
        <md>
          <mrow>8000 &amp; = ab^0</mrow>
          <mrow>4000 &amp; =ab^{5730}</mrow>
        </md>
        This clearly means that <m>a=8000</m>, and 
        <md>
          \frac{1}{2} &amp; = b^{5730} \Longrightarrow b = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{5730}} 
        </md>
        We can therefore say that
        <me>
          R(t)=8000\left(\frac12\right)^{\frac1{5730}t}
        </me>
        We can now determine how many atoms remain radioactive after 100 years
        <me>
          R(100)\approx 7904
        </me> 
        Approximately 7904 atoms remain radioactive after 100 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        How long it would take until there are only 6000 radioactive atoms remaining?
        We need to solve the equation 
        <me>
          6000=8000\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{5730}}
        </me>
        Using a graphing calculator, we obtain 
        <m>t\approx 2378</m>. We conclude that 6000 radioactive atoms remain after approximately <m>2378</m> years.

        You invest <dollar/>5000 in an account that pays <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> simple interest. What is

        <p>
          To find when the investment will double in value, our first thought might

          </me>
          for <m>t</m>. This is problematic in that the solution to this equation is almost 
          certainly non-integer and the domain of our function is restricted to the 
          integers. A more straight forward approach might be to simply find the first 
          year the balance is at least <dollar/>10,000.

      use a slightly more complicated system.

        <p> Two brothers, Michael and Fredo, each deposited <dollar/>100 into brand new bank accounts.</p>
        <p>
          Michael's bank account gave him a <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> annual interest rate. 
          How much money did he have in his account after one year if he earned 
          <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> in simple annual interest?
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to calculate <m>100(1.12) = 112</m>. Michael had <dollar/>112 after one year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fredo's bank account gave him a <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> annual rate compounded monthly, 
          which means that each month he received one-twelfth of the <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> (which is 
          <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> interest) on his account:

          We complete <xref ref="exp-tab-fredo"/> using

          Fredo didn't actually earn <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> interest after one year on his initial investment, 
          so the <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> is in name only, and is called the {\em nominal} 
          interest rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          After one year, what percent did Fredo actually earn?  We calculate the <em>effective rate</em>: 
          <me>
            \left( 1+\frac{0.12}{12} \right)^{12}-1\approx 0.126825 
          </me> 
          The effective rate is approximately <quantity><mag>12.68</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that although both Michael and Fredo both had accounts that were nominally at <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> annual interest, they ended up with different effective annual interest rates due to the different compounding periods.  
        </p>
        <p>
          A third brother, Sonny, invested <dollar/>100 into another account. His account earned 
          <quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> nominal rate compounded daily. This means that he earned <m>\frac{<quantity><mag>12</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>}{365}</m>, which is approximately 
          <quantity><mag>0.0328767</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> each day. 
          Find how much money Sonny had in his account after 1 year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We calculate
          <me>
            100\left(1+\frac{0.12}{365}  \right)^{365}\approx 112.75
          </me>
          and therefore Sonny had <dollar/>112.75 after one year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We can calculate the effective interest rate on Sonny's account using

      We have covered a lot of rates including growth rates and decay rates. In the context of finance we've talked 
      about nominal interest rates and effective interest rates. Recall that the nominal interest rate 
      is the stated rate before any compounding has been applied.
      Now we will formally define effective interest rate.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a nominal annual interest rate, <m>r</m>, and a compounding frequency, <m>n</m>, the effective rate 
          is the interest rate that is <em>actually</em> earned over the course of one year. 
          The effective rate is calculated using the expression
          <me>
            \left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^n - 1

          The quantity <m>\left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^n</m> represents the annual growth factor defined in <xref ref="exp-def-growthfactorrate"/>.
          This comes from the compound interest formula (<xref ref="exp-def-compoundint"/>) and the equality

      <title>Atmospheric C-14</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          During the Cold War, many above-ground thermonuclear tests were done in the South 
          Pacific region, making many islands completely uninhabitable for decades (if not centuries) due to lingering 
          radiation. In fact, the thermonuclear testing drastically increased the amount of atmospheric C-14 above normal levels worldwide. In this problem, we are going to investigate the long-term effects of worldwide 
          nuclear testing half 
          a world away from the South Pacific.

          Almost every compound in your body is replaced frequently by the food, water, and air that you take in.  
          One of the few exceptions is the enamel in your teeth.  Enamel is formed in early childhood, and is never replaced.   
          Whatever C-14 level was in the atmosphere at that time becomes permanently locked in your teeth.  Because the 
          half-life of C-14 is so long, the level will remain steady throughout your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forensic scientists have found a fascinating application for this information.  After the devastating tsunami in 
          Indonesia in 2004, there were many unidentified bodies.  To help identify bodies with the names on lists of 
          missing persons, researchers examined the C-14 level in the teeth of the tsunami victims.  Through comparison with 
          known C-14 levels, the forensic scientists were able to determine the birth year of victims to within 18 months.

        In 2005 a town has <m>1000</m> barrels of oil in a well. Some of the oil is easy to reach and some 
        of it is hard to reach. As more of the easily accessible oil is drilled, the amount that they can drill 
        in a given year is reduced.  In fact, limitations of drilling equipment lead to a <quantity><mag>20</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> reduction in drilling capacity each year. In 2005, <m>200</m> barrels of oil were drilled. 
        Let <m>Q(t)</m> represent the amount of oil (in barrels) that is drilled where <m>t</m> is the number of years after 2005. Assume that in each year the town drills to its maximum capacity.

        <statement>
          Do you think there would be much difference if the interest was compounded 
          every half second compared to compounding it every second?

        <solution>
          <p>
            No practical difference.

        <answer>
          <p>
            The compounding frequency would be <m>31536000\cdot 2 = 63072000</m>
            <me>
              \left( 1+\frac{0.06}{63072000} \right)^{63072000}-1 \approx 0.06183696
