    <title>Simple population models</title>
    <p>
            Exponential functions are often used to model the size of a population as time passes.  A population 
            could be growing or declining at an exponential rate.
</p>
<definition>
  <title>Simple population model</title>
  <statement>
  <p>
            If an initial population, <m>P_0</m>, changes by the same percentage each year, then 
            the population at time <m>t</m> in years, <m>P(t)</m>, is given by the formula
            <me>
            P(t)=P_0(1+r)^t, 
            </me>
            where <m>r</m> is the decimal form of the percentage change.
</p>
<p>
            When dealing with human population models, we generally restrict the domain of <m>P</m> to integer values of <m>t</m>. This 
            means that we are only modeling population values on one specific day of the year.
</p>
<p>
            Note that <m>r</m> can be positive (for a growing population) or negative (for a declining population).  
            Also, note that we don't have to measure time in years.  Using years makes sense for modeling human populations, 
            but a smaller unit like hours might make sense for a bacteria population.

            <statement>
            Since 2001 the population of an inner city has been decreasing as people 
            move to the suburbs. It is decreasing at a rate of <quantity><mag>1</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> per year; find a model 
            for this situation.
</statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
            Let <m>P(t)</m> be the population of the inner city at time <m>t</m> in years since 2001. 
            Let <m>P_0</m> be the population of the inner city in 2001.
            Then, since <m>r=-0.01</m>,
            <me>
            P(t) = P_0(0.99)^t

            <date>  Apr 2011</date>
            <statement>
            At the beginning of the year 2000, the population of One Horse was 10,000 people. By the beginning
            of 2005 the population had decreased to 9700. Assuming exponential decay, determine the population 
            at the beginning of 2012. Round your answer to the nearest person.
</statement>
            <solution>
              <p>Over 5 years, the population decreased by 300 people.  As <m>\frac{300}{10000}=0.03</m>, the population 
            decreased by <quantity><mag>3</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> over the five-year period.  The growth factor for this five-year period is <m>0.97</m> and 
            therefore the growth factor for one year is <m>(0.97)^{1/5}</m>.  Using this, the population <m>P(t)</m> at 
            time <m>t</m> in years after 2000 can be represented by
            <me>
            P(t) = 10000\left(0.97\right)^{t/5}
            </me>  
            To estimate the population in 2012, we evaluate <m>P(12)</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow>P(12) &amp; = 10000\left(0.97\right)^{12/5}</mrow>
              <mrow>&amp; \approx 9295                    </mrow>
            </md>
            In 2012, the population of One Horse is expected to be approximately 9,295 people. </p>
